# employee-tracker

## Description

The employee-tracker has been created in order to have an organized and quick way of accessing and modifying employee's information, the department they work in, their role, who is the manager, and salary. This solves the problem of having a disorganized way of keeping track of the information with how strict sql can be and have an easy way to edit or view certain tables if needed. Working on this project showed me how to incorporate sql with routes and inquirer and getting them to work together. Also helped me learned more about using sql, letting me get more familiar and comfortable working with databases.


## Installation

To get the project to work properly, you will need to install Node js. v16, figlet, table, mysql, and express. In order to do that, open VS Code and in the integrated terminal, type in npm init -y and npm i for the packages, npm i express --save to install express, npm install figlet to get figlet, mysql -u root -p then source the schema and seeds sql files, and finally npm install table to get the table. 

## Usage

After everything has been installed, open the integrated terminal, type node index and then you will be greeted with employee manager in big text and a list of options to pick from that you can either view tables or add more information.
